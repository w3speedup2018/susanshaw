We continue to encourage our customers to first shop locally. In 2018 our e-commerce site was launched, making it accessible for customers to shop our entire catalog. We are headquartered in San Antonio, TX, where our talented artists make each piece of jewelry by hand, and our marketing, customer service, and fulfillment teams all work under the same roof.<\/p><p><strong>FAQs:<\/strong><\/p><p><strong>What is handcast gold?<\/strong><\/p><p>All Susan Shaw jewelry is either 24Kt handcast gold plated or handcast sterling silver plated. Handcasting is a plating method done by hand. This method produces the most consistent and highest quality plating possible and is far superior to standard machine plating. Our pieces are handcast with three coats of 24Kt gold or sterling silver. All items are plated over a lead-free, nickel-free base metal.<\/p><p><strong>Is your pearl jewelry real?<\/strong><\/p><p>None of our jewelry is made using plastic pieces. All items are comprised of <a href=\"https:\/\/susanshaw.com\/collections\/freshwater-pearls\" title=\"CULTURED PEARLS\"><strong>genuine freshwater pearls<\/strong><\/a> or semi-precious stones, including genuine turquoise, quartz, coral, onyx, and agate. Our <a href=\"https:\/\/susanshaw.com\/collections\/cotton-pearl\" title=\"COTTON PEARL JEWELRY\"><strong>cotton pearl collection<\/strong><\/a> is unique and unlike genuine pearls. A cotton pearl contains a tightly wound inner-layer of cotton with a paper-maché-like outer layer. They are extremely light weight, giving you the benefit of bigger pearls without the bulky weight.<\/p><p><strong>How long are the necklaces and bracelets?<\/strong><\/p><p>Short <a href=\"https:\/\/susanshaw.com\/collections\/necklaces\" title=\"https:\/\/susanshaw.com\/collections\/necklaces\">necklaces<\/a> featured are generally 16\" and each include a 3\" extender chain, and comfortably worn between 16-19\".  Longer chains are generally 30\".<\/p><p>Bracelets are generally 7.5\" to 8\" but depend on the design and materials used. All product pages should include a piece's length and our team is working on model images for all designs for size reference.<\/p><p><strong>How do I clean my Susan Shaw jewelry?<\/strong><\/p><p>As is the case with all jewelry regardless of manufacturer or method of plating, alcohol based sprays (such as perfume and hairspray), if sprayed directly on to the pieces, may over time eat away at the silver or gold plate.  In order to preserve the original state of the jewelry, Susan Shaw suggests you simply apply your sprays before putting on any jewelry. To clean your jewelry, use a dry microfiber cloth.<\/p>","button_label":"","button_link":"","text_size":"featured_text","text_alignment":"center","css_class":"","custom_css":""}},"1658769877e90312dd":{"type":"divider","settings":{"divider_spacing":5,"divider_border":false,"css_class":"","custom_css":""}},"165880755247dd1cd2":{"type":"featured-collection","settings":{"background_color":"","title":"Our Customers also love","collection_description":true,"collection":"best-sellers","collection_style":"grid","products_per":4,"products_limit":8,"css_class":"","custom_css":""}},"1658807595a883fa99":{"type":"recently-viewed","settings":{"rv_title":"Recently viewed products","rv_max_display":6,"rv_per":4,"css_class":"","custom_css":""}},"newsletter":{"type":"newsletter","settings":{"wide_display":true,"display_first_name":false,"display_last_name":false,"newsletter_title":"Never miss another sale","newsletter_text":"","newsletter_section_text_align":"center","css_class":"","custom_css":""}}},"order":["main","165876926337be7848","1658807497460b2f38","1658769877e90312dd","165880755247dd1cd2","1658807595a883fa99","newsletter"]}
