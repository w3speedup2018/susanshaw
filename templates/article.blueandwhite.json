In this collection, Susan blends her favorite elements of her own home with ready to wear pieces for the modern woman.Susan's passion for blue and white stems from long admiring her mother's collection of blue and white English Spode transferware. When she was first introduced to Chinese blue and white porcelain many decades ago, she immediately noted the similarities of the restful color palettes and admired the intricacies of the centuries old patterns.Her jewelry collections have always been inspired by her world, including her travels, nature, art, and interiors. Blue and white is an interior choice that has proven to be timeless and a color way that goes with everything. To bring the collection to life, Susan paired handpainted porcelain beads with common chinoiserie motifs and signature Susan Shaw materials including baroque pearls, bamboo pieces and the native Chinese Ginkgo leaf.  <\/p>","button_label":"","link":"","button_label_2":"","link_2":"","bg_color":"","text_color":""}},"8cc2708b-d7aa-4f62-baa3-6c9b112cdde9":{"type":"image","settings":{"image":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/mbw06272_GQ5I.jpg","image_crop":"none","subtitle":"","title":"AN ARTFUL MIX","text":"<p><em><strong>Susan has incorporated blue and white into nearly every room in her home.

My childhood home was surrounded by my mother's collection of blue and white flow blue china, ginger jars, and bits of our favorite hue throughout. The love for the combination has only grown, and I still squeal every time I score a new piece to add to my very own collection! When I met Grace Hamlin, at Pre K pick up a few years ago, I knew we'd become good friends. I can remember coming to her house for the first time for a play date, and seeing her blue & white ginger jar collection, and it really took my breath away! We've bonded over blue and white, chinoiserie everything, thrift store scores, our love for rattan, and our love for each other's babies ... among many other things! That's why it was so fun to be a part of this new Susan Shaw launch together, with my fellow blue & white lover, Grace!\"  <\/em><\/p>","link_ig":"http:\/\/https\/\/www.instagram.com\/sarahgtucker\/","link_website":"https:\/\/sarah-tucker.com\/"}},"template--16732076572887__feae9db5-de76-4a3f-aeaa-cceedbff6232-16777335843dba96da-1":{"type":"image","settings":{"image":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/untitled3_MQrx_570x549_crop_center_cc44b9ed-7b55-472f-b2df-6312e4646557.png","title":"Grace Hamlin","text":"<p><em>\"My love for blue and white encapsulates so much of what I enjoy about decorating and styling because somehow the enduring color combination finds its place among current trends, while its timelessness speaks to a sense of classic and traditional beauty.
