Her husband, KR Rombauer, is 2nd generation Proprietor of renowned Napa Valley winery Rombauer Vineyards. <br\/><br\/>We love the family and multi-generational aspect of the Rombauer family operations - as we too, are family owned and operated. Rombauer Vineyards Founders Koerner and Joan Rombauer moved their family to the Napa Valley in 1972 after Koerner retired from a long career in commercial aviation. Rombauer Vineyards first wine release was in 1984. Rombauer Vineyards Carneros Chardonnay quickly put the winery on the map as a Napa Valley institution and destination. With a family history rooted in appreciation for the culinary arts and wine, establishing a winery of their own felt natural. Founders Koerner and Joan have now since passed, but both 2nd and 3rd generation Rombauer Vineyards family members are actively involved in the family business, passing down the knowledge and expertise that has made the brand a household name.  <br\/><br\/>The Rombauer family shares a love for entertaining across generations. The Joy of Cooking was written by Irma Rombauer, Koerner's great aunt, who championed reliable recipes that became a staple in the American kitchen. Today, Laura Rombauer and 3rd generation daughter, Ransome Rombauer, expresses their family entertaining style through their thoughtfully curated shop, Napa Valley Vintage Home. Laura's love of entertaining, setting a beautiful table and cooking for friends and family is clearly evident at both the family home, the winery and at the shop. Laura's passion for entertaining and her husband's, \"KR\", for the wine business complement each other and make way for memorable meals together centered around family, food and wine.  <br\/><br\/>Photography by Nicole Marino, Bigshot in Winecountry Media<\/p>","button_label":"","link":"","button_label_2":"","link_2":"","bg_color":"","text_color":""}},"995033b9-3f27-4b48-912e-8bb009b7bc28":{"type":"image","settings":{"image":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/table-5_xpR2.jpg","image_crop":"none","subtitle":"","title":"Inviting Entertaining Spaces","text":"<p>This fall we are embracing natural elements when setting the table. For this shoot, we arranged deer sheds (a nod to our South Texas roots) to the table's center. They combined beautifully with the seasonally hued florals set in Blue & White porcelain. Flickering candles putting off amber light added an additional warm feeling to the space, inviting guests in to sit and stay a while. While you may be all dressed up, everyone wants to feel at ease at the table. <br\/><br\/>Bringing the tones and textures of fall to the table will cultivate an inviting space, encouraging long and joyful meals for making memories.
