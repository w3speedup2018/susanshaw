I think my interest in learning etiquette came really because of an insecurity of not truly knowing the correct way to eat with my silverware or how to introduce someone properly in business. When I went to etiquette school while working abroad in London, I was astonished at what I learned, and eventually enrolled into Swiss Finishing School and then trained under a former member of Her Majesty the Queen’s household staff. I have started hosting cocktail parties where I would teach my peers what I learned (just for fun) and soon it became a hot ticket in town, and I had 50-60 people showing up every week and I knew I was onto something. I started my company Beaumont Etiquette and then moved back to NYC in 2013 where I opened an office and started teaching etiquette there. I founded The Plaza Hotel Finishing Program in 2016 and wrote two books Modern Etiquette Made Easy and Business Etiquette Made Easy. Today I teach across the US and world instructing corporate and private groups, traveling as a keynote speaker, and running my NYC based etiquette company with my amazing team.<\/p>","font_size":14,"button_label":"","link":"","button_label_2":"","link_2":"","bg_color":"","text_color":""}},"template--16995796582615__9d454083-342d-4c55-8254-c9266cb4056d-image-2":{"type":"image","settings":{"image":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/toile4x4_1_69ab853b-5a54-4fa5-81a4-f0e728b7a067.jpg","image_crop":"none","subtitle":"Q: The Plaza Hotel Etiquette program?
