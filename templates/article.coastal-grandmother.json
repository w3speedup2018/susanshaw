Inspired by the fabulous and relatable characters in Nancy Meyers' films, and icons like Ina Garten, this look is all about classic style and leisurely living. Taking social media by storm, the coastal grandmother aesthetic is not a new look, rather, a new name for timeless style.  <br\/><br\/>One doesn't need to live by the coast, or be a grandparent, to embrace the internet's latest trend. The coastal grandmother lifestyle is open to all ages and locales. Twenty six year old TikToker Lex Nicoleta, who coined the term, is far from the coastal grandmother that comes to mind as the name may suggest. A millennial living in inland California, she fully identifies with the coastal grandmother lifestyle, and shares the aesthetic with her followers.  <br\/><br\/>Hallmarks of the trend are soft color palettes and natural textures in both wardrobe and interiors, but the coastal grandmother look is much more than a cozy sweater and linen pants. The way of life is being widely adopted by younger generations, which feels timely as book clubs are cool again, simple cooking reigns supreme, knowledge of wine is power, and at home dinner parties are the new night out. There is something nostalgic about this aesthetic that feels familiar and refreshing.<br\/><\/p>","text_alignment":"center","css_class":"","custom_css":""}},"736a4145-7c21-4097-9648-24978630a722":{"type":"divider","settings":{"divider_spacing":20,"divider_border":false,"css_class":"","custom_css":""}},"3e8ed5d8-839e-48b9-8342-bf5a17a6258e":{"type":"article-gallery","blocks":{"template--16731834056919__3e8ed5d8-839e-48b9-8342-bf5a17a6258e-1677662305190587a0-0":{"type":"image","settings":{"image":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/cgm31_FfyA_1.jpg"}},"template--16731834056919__3e8ed5d8-839e-48b9-8342-bf5a17a6258e-1677662305190587a0-1":{"type":"image","settings":{"image":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/cgm4_japo.jpg"}},"template--16731834056919__3e8ed5d8-839e-48b9-8342-bf5a17a6258e-1677662305190587a0-2":{"type":"image","settings":{"image":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/cgm5_ojl3.jpg"}},"template--16731834056919__3e8ed5d8-839e-48b9-8342-bf5a17a6258e-1677662305190587a0-3":{"type":"image","settings":{"image":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/cgm61_Ssan.jpg"}},"template--16731834056919__3e8ed5d8-839e-48b9-8342-bf5a17a6258e-1677662305190587a0-4":{"type":"image","settings":{"image":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/cgm_GPBW.jpg"}},"template--16731834056919__3e8ed5d8-839e-48b9-8342-bf5a17a6258e-1677662305190587a0-5":{"type":"image","settings":{"image":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/cgm7_kh2V.jpg"}}},"block_order":["template--16731834056919__3e8ed5d8-839e-48b9-8342-bf5a17a6258e-1677662305190587a0-0","template--16731834056919__3e8ed5d8-839e-48b9-8342-bf5a17a6258e-1677662305190587a0-1","template--16731834056919__3e8ed5d8-839e-48b9-8342-bf5a17a6258e-1677662305190587a0-2","template--16731834056919__3e8ed5d8-839e-48b9-8342-bf5a17a6258e-1677662305190587a0-3","template--16731834056919__3e8ed5d8-839e-48b9-8342-bf5a17a6258e-1677662305190587a0-4","template--16731834056919__3e8ed5d8-839e-48b9-8342-bf5a17a6258e-1677662305190587a0-5"],"settings":{"wide_display":false,"title":"","gallery_type":"classic","grid-size":3,"enable_lightbox":true,"css_class":"","custom_css":""}},"8508df7d-dcc4-4ea0-983b-05366d452b6c":{"type":"article-text","settings":{"title":"#susanshawstyle is all about #coastalgrandmother","content":"<p>Minimalism is what separates the coastal grandmother from the grandmillenial.
