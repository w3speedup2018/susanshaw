I also have two brothers and married into a family of all boys, so I would like to say that I bring the girl power to the family! All of that to say, I went through recruitment at Auburn and had a great experience. I truly believe that you can build lifelong friendships, you can grow independence, you can learn so much about yourself and be a part of something bigger than just yourself.<\/p><p>I absolutely loved it, and I didn’t have a lot of older girls pulling for me; I definitely talked my way through engaging conversations and really focused on connecting and meeting new people and absolutely loved [the process] for that reason. I did not know that you have to wear a black dress on pref at Auburn, and I remember feeling like everyone had gotten the memo that you wear black except for me. I just wished that I had an older sister that would’ve told me [what to do as I went throughout the process].<\/p><p>I graduated from Auburn in 2019 and was working as the internal and external event planner at Children’s Healthcare<em> <\/em>in Atlanta, planning their big fundraising galas. While on the side, I had moms text me from my hometown asking me to help their daughter with what to wear and what she should say [during recruitment]. I was one of the first girls to go out of state from Knoxville to Auburn, so I was getting these texts, and it was so fun for me. So I was just doing it on the side really – helping [PNMs] here and there. <\/p><p>Then, COVID hit, and I had an influx of people reaching out to me because they still did recruitment – but it was online and all videos. That was tough, but I still helped girls through the process. Each year, by word of mouth, [my job helping PNMs prepare for recruitment] kind of grew naturally, and I started to host group webinars. (Laughs) I didn’t mean for it to be a whole thing. <\/p><p>In 2022, I created an online course called the ‘Everything Package’ that helps girls from start to finish. They learn everything they should know from confidence building, to styling, to resumes, to reference letters, to letters of support. We really focus on helping girls from a holistic approach – our tagline is that ‘We celebrate happy bid days and girls who are becoming young women along the way.’ I love the art of the thank you note and all of that kind of stuff, so we teach those things in the online course, and that is when the business really started to grow quickly. Now, girls could get recruitment ready from anywhere – from Europe, from their home, anywhere! It wasn’t just one-on-one coaching any longer. I do still coach one-on-one, and we do styling, conversation prep, etc. Last year we had requests for help in general styling, etiquette, and confidence building, so we also have another side of the business that helps girls with those kinds of things that’s unrelated to sorority recruitment. That being said, our main focus is getting girls ready for sorority recruitment, and it’s honestly just been a joy. It’s been fun to step into entrepreneurship – which is not something I thought I would be doing, but it really grew organically, and I’m grateful for the opportunity.  <\/p>","font_size":18,"text_alignment":"align_left","css_class":"","custom_css":""}},"e24eb7b1-d30d-43d5-b800-1738311a936f":{"type":"article-image-with-text-overlay","settings":{"wide_display":true,"image":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/recruitmentready.png","pretext":"","title":"","subtitle":"","text_color":"","button1":"","button1_link":"","button1_color":"","button1_style":"global-button--banner","button2":"","button2_link":"","button2_style":"global-button--banner","text_top":10,"text_left":10,"text_position":"center","text_align":"center","caption_content_background":"original","mobile_image_crop":"none","m_title":"","m_subtitle":"","mobile_text_below_image":true,"mobile_text_color":"","css_class":"","custom_css":""}},"49bb666b-0ed2-41f0-9ba9-a00eff352c25":{"type":"article-image-text","blocks":{"template--16810561372375__49bb666b-0ed2-41f0-9ba9-a00eff352c25-16897129330e3316ad-1":{"type":"image","settings":{"image":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/Screen_Shot_2023-07-19_at_10.52.35_AM.png","image_crop":"none","subtitle":"","title":"","text":"<h3><strong>Q: Can you tell us more about your styling recommendations for PNMs going through recruitment?<\/strong><\/h3><p><strong>LN:<\/strong> “I always recommend girls dress themselves in a way they feel cute, classy, and confident.

It varies on school depending on what to wear specifically, but we do a lot of sun dresses, a lot of bold colors, and fun patterns. A lot of schools also require a Panhellenic t-shirt round, so I help girls make a t-shirt look cute – I am a big fan of the structured front tuck for that. That being said, I do encourage girls to pick patterns and styles that make them feel most like themselves and remind them they don’t have to be someone that they’re not to get into a sorority.
