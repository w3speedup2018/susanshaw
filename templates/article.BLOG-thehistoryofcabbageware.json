Icons like Jackie Kennedy Onassis set their grand tablescapes with Thayer's cabbage creations, and her pieces sell at auction for tens of thousands of dollars to this day. With vegetable-inspired varieties now created in colors ranging from pink to classic cabbage-green, our pendants were designed after cabbage plates from Susan's personal collection. <\/p>","button_label":"","link":"","button_label_2":"","link_2":"","bg_color":"","text_color":""}}},"block_order":["image_rEy46c"],"settings":{"wide_display":false,"bgcolor":"","featured_links_per_row":"1","frontpage_text_align":"left","frontpage_image_position":"row","css_class":"","custom_css":""}},"article_text_6HbTxR":{"type":"article-text","settings":{"title":"","content":"","font_size":18,"text_alignment":"center","css_class":"","custom_css":""}},"article_image_text_q3MAVB":{"type":"article-image-text","blocks":{"image_Ea6J4R":{"type":"image","settings":{"image":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/Asset_7_150x_6fcd2642-eca8-4177-9a85-5c034797bca1.png","image_crop":"none","subtitle":"","title":"","text":"<p>A quick scroll on Instagram or Pinterest will show you just how popular cabbage tableware has become.
