Each piece is lightweight and designed to be easy to wear and versatile, but give women a sense of stylish elegance and grace. \n<br>\n<br>\n<b><i>\n“I’m a Texan and a Southerner, which means I come from a long line of women who don’t leave the house until they are put together,” <\/i><\/b> says Shaw of her quest to design everyday pieces for the woman who wants to look elegant every day. <b><i> “But as a busy working mother, I learned early on that it doesn’t matter how beautiful a piece is, if it isn’t effortless, you won’t wear it.”\n<br>\n<br>\n<\/i><\/b>It is this attention to detail and awareness of how real women live, work and dress, that have made these timeless silhouettes a family tradition among women of style.
