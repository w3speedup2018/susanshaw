The changing season is more often marked by football kickoffs or the State Fair, and for those of us who enjoy the wide open spaces, it might be weekends enjoying ranch life. With slightly cooler temperatures, sweeping landscapes to roam and wildlife to explore, ranch life is a tranquil escape and preferred way for us Texans to unwind for the weekend. A Saturday during dove season is well spent with family and friends, exploring the Texas terrain, tuning in to college football and capping off the night with a good meal and a sunset drive. There's nothing quite like it to fill your bucket. We decided to capture the season in our state by heading out to the Hill Country and styling our Fall line with some of our favorite Texas brands.  <\/p>","button_label":"","link":"","button_label_2":"","link_2":"","bg_color":"","text_color":""}},"6cfabe12-6776-417a-a28b-e2379480e7ec":{"type":"image","settings":{"image":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/untitled3_0NAp.png","image_crop":"none","subtitle":"","title":"SOUTHERN HOSPITALITY WITH WESTERN SPIRIT","text":"<p>Just because you're out in the country doesn't mean you have to rough it!

Hand Blown in Poland, Estelle's \"jewels for your table\", make for a lovely staple for entertaining or the ideal hostess gift.
