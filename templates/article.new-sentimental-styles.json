During this time in history, the Temple Treasury had 13 chests that were placed in the Women’s Court at the Temple. Each of these wooden chests had metal, trumpet-shaped mouths on top, and all offerings were placed in these collection chests. <\/p><p>Many people came to the Temple Treasury to make these offerings, and these monetary donations came in all shapes and sizes. Many large offerings supported the needs of the Temple, and the coins dropped in could clearly be heard through the metal mouths of the chests. <\/p><p>One day, a poor widow entered the Temple Treasury, and she quietly dropped two copper coins into one of the chests. After her husband’s death, she had no source of income, and these two coins, which were the smallest and least valuable of the time, were all that she had. <\/p><p>Although the offering may not have seemed like much in comparison to some of the larger sums given, it is important to note that the widow gave out of her own freewill and chose to give everything that she had to God. Although she had nothing else to spare, she didn’t hold anything back and chose to make this sacrifice with a glad heart and willing generosity. The widow chose to make this sacrifice out of love and humility, and she sought no recognition in return.<\/p>","button_label":"","link":"","button_label_2":"","link_2":"","bg_color":"","text_color":""}},"c61a7a4d-725e-469e-ab1e-a869dccd08ef":{"type":"image","settings":{"image":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/widowsmiteblog.png","image_crop":"none","subtitle":"","title":"","text":"<p>Jesus watched this offering being made, and He stopped to explain just how much significance the sacrifice held. He explained that the widow had made the greatest sacrifice of all by giving everything that she had and holding nothing back. We know now, that Jesus would make the greatest sacrifice of all by giving His life through death on the cross. In the Bible writings, He goes on to say that the amount of the gift is not the most important part of things laid down to God, but instead, the amount sacrificed is what matters. These personal sacrifices may never be seen by man or the favor “returned,” but they mean the most to the Father. A heart of abundance recognizes that God is the Ultimate Provider and teaches man to trust in His provisions. <\/p><p>This story is often referred to as the “Widow’s Mite,” and our new Widow’s Mite collection features the two coins mentioned in this Bible story. The two, small coins are a visual reminder of this message on sacrifice and how we can choose to make these intentional sacrifices in our daily lives. It shows us that we are constantly given the opportunity to make sacrifices, and we should approach them with the same attitude that the widow modeled – joyfully giving everything that we have. <\/p><p><\/p><p><strong>MARK 12:41-44, LUKE 21:1-6<\/strong><\/p><p><\/p><p><\/p>","button_label":"Shop Widow's Mite","link":"shopify:\/\/collections\/widows-mite","button_label_2":"","link_2":"","bg_color":"","text_color":""}},"600af388-54e9-4969-9e97-8f5c971e89cc":{"type":"image","settings":{"image":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/angel2.png","image_crop":"none","subtitle":"","title":"","text":"<p>From the archives, Susan pulled this angel pendant and reimagined it with a modern paperclip chain and newly popular beaded border.
